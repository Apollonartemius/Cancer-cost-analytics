# Cancer-cost-analytics
Data analysis project using Excel, Power BI & Tableau to visualize cancer risk and treatment cost.

1. Cancer Risk & Cost Analytics Dashboard

This project analyzes a large-scale cancer dataset of 50,000 patients using **Excel**, **Power BI**, and **Tableau**. The objective was to uncover insights related to treatment costs, survival outcomes, risk levels, and demographic disparities across multiple regions and cancer types.

2. Project Overview

- Cleaned and enriched the dataset with custom columns for **Risk Level**, **Treatment Cost Tier**, and **Survival Category** using Excel formulas (`IF`, `AVERAGEIF`, etc.).
- Created **interactive dashboards** in **Power BI** and **Tableau** to visualize KPIs across gender, cancer stage, region, and cost brackets.
- Used **DAX queries** to derive age groups, survival percentages, death ratios, and high-risk flags based on environmental and genetic factors.
- Applied **statistical analysis** (including correlation) to understand the relationship between risk factors (like smoking, air pollution) and cancer severity.

3. Tools & Technologies Used

- Microsoft Excel – Pivot tables, custom formulas, risk modeling
- Power BI – DAX queries, KPI dashboards, slicers, filters
- Tableau – Visual analytics (bar charts, scatter plots, pie charts)


4.  Key Insights

- Stage IV cancers- contributed to the highest total cost burden (~$1.52B), while **Stage 0** showed the highest average survival.
- Lung and Breast cancer were the most economically impactful cancer types.
- Patients classified as "High Risk" (Genetic Risk, Smoking, etc.) had lower survival rates and higher treatment costs.
- Gender disparities and **regional economic differences** were clearly visible in cost and survival distribution.
